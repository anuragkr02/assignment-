    "If the dataset has an odd number of values, the median is the middle value. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. It is a good measure of central tendency for datasets with outliers or skewed distributions.\n",
    "The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. It is used as a measure of central tendency for datasets with discrete values or categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each measure of central tendency provides a different perspective on the dataset. The mean is sensitive to extreme values or outliers, while the median is more robust to them. The mode is useful for identifying the most common value in the dataset.\n",
    "Depending on the nature of the dataset and the research question, one or more of these measures of central tendency may be appropriate to use. For example, if we have a dataset of incomes, the mean may be a good representation of the typical income, but if the dataset includes a few individuals with extremely high incomes, the median may be a better measure of central tendency."

The range is the simplest measure of dispersion, which is defined as the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset. The variance and standard deviation are more sophisticated measures that take into account the distance of each data point from the mean.\n",
